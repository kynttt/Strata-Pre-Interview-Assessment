## 1. Setup & Running the Project

### Live Demo

The app is deployed and can be tested at:  
**[https://strata-pre-interview-assessment.vercel.app/](https://strata-pre-interview-assessment.vercel.app/)**

To try it out, go to **Configure AI**, enter your API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google), choose a model, and save. Then go to **Enquiries** and click **Process** on any sample conversation.

> **New to the app?** See the full step-by-step walkthrough: **[Process Flow Guide](docs/process-flow.md)** — covers everything from configuration to sending a response back to the client.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) An API key from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google
- (Optional) Ollama installed locally for offline demo mode

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) Add default API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your keys

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### First-Time Configuration

1. Click **Configure AI** in the top navigation.
2. Select a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Ollama).
3. Enter your API key and choose a model (not needed for Ollama).
4. Click **Save**. Configuration is stored in `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

**Free tier recommendations:**
- **Google Gemini** — Use `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`. Google offers a generous free tier with rate limits suitable for testing.
- **OpenAI** — Use `gpt-4o`. OpenAI provides limited free credits for new accounts; after that a paid plan is required.

### Using Ollama (Local / Offline)

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. In the Configure AI page, select **Ollama** and model `llama3.2`.
4. Leave the API key blank.

**Note:** Local models are slower. The timeout is set to 60 seconds for Ollama vs. 10 seconds for cloud providers.

## 2. Confidence Scoring

### What It Is

Every enquiry that enters the system receives a **confidence score** from the AI classifier — a float between `0.0` and `1.0`. This score represents how certain the model is about its classification, and it is the single most important signal for deciding whether to automate the next steps or escalate to a human.

### How It Is Calibrated

The `classify-enquiry` skill explicitly anchors the model's interpretation of confidence:

```markdown
- `confidence` must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0.
- 0.9+ means you are very sure
- 0.7-0.9 means reasonably sure
- below 0.7 means uncertain
```

This calibration is critical because **different models interpret "confidence" differently**. GPT-4o might give 0.95 for an obvious case, while a local llama3.2 might give 0.85 for the same input. By telling the model exactly what each band means, the 0.7 threshold becomes meaningful across all four supported providers.

### The 0.7 Threshold (Orchestrator Rule)

In `src/lib/process-enquiry.ts`:

```typescript
const classification = classifyRes.data;
const needsReview =
  classification.confidence < 0.7 || classification.type === "needs_clarification";
```

| Confidence | Orchestrator Action | User Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `>= 0.7` | Proceed to `route-enquiry` + `generate-response` | Routing badge + Generate Response button |
| `< 0.7` | Skip downstream skills; flag for human review | "Needs Review" badge + reason displayed |

**Why 0.7?**
- It catches genuinely ambiguous input without being so strict that normal enquiries constantly escalate.
- The prompt calibration explicitly tells the model "below 0.7 means uncertain," so the boundary is respected.
- It prevents wasted tokens: if confidence is low, the orchestrator skips expensive routing and response generation calls entirely.

### Where It Appears in the UI

1. **Dashboard row** (`EnquiryRow`) — a small green progress bar + percentage badge
2. **Enquiry detail card** (`EnquiryEntryCard`) — an animated confidence bar with numeric readout
3. **Conversation header** (`/enquiries` page) — inline text: `new client · Sales · high · 92% confidence`
4. **Email drawer** (`EnquiryDrawer`) — large animated bar with percentage inside the bar

### Example Flow

**Input:** "I want to book a consultation about strata management."

```json
{
  "type": "new_client",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "reasoning": "The user explicitly asks about booking a consultation, which signals a new-client intent."
}
```

→ Confidence 0.94 ≥ 0.7 → proceeds to routing → Sales team, medium priority → response generated.

**Input:** "help"

```json
{
  "type": "needs_clarification",
  "confidence": 0.42,
  "reasoning": "The message is too vague to determine intent.",
  "draft": "Thank you for reaching out. Could you let us know what you need help with?"
}
```

→ Confidence 0.42 < 0.7 → flagged for review → clarification draft surfaced in UI.

## 3. Prompt Engineering

### Philosophy: Skills as Markdown

Prompts are **first-class code artifacts**, not inline strings buried in TypeScript. Each AI task lives in its own `skill.md` file:

```
src/skills/classify-enquiry/
  skill.md   — system prompt, instructions, output constraints
  index.ts   — thin runner wrapper
```

**Why this matters:**
- Non-engineers can tune prompts without touching code.
- Prompts are versioned in git alongside the code.
- Each skill has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- The skill runner reads the markdown at runtime and passes it as the `systemPrompt` to the AI provider.

### The Three Skills

#### 1. `classify-enquiry`

**Responsibility:** Categorise the enquiry into exactly one of five types and return a calibrated confidence score.

**Key constraints in the prompt:**
- Five categories: `new_client`, `support_request`, `complaint`, `general_question`, `needs_clarification`
- `confidence` must be 0.0–1.0 with explicit calibration bands
- `reasoning` must be one concise sentence explaining the choice
- `draft` is `null` except for `needs_clarification`, where it becomes a polite follow-up question

**Output format enforced:**
```json
{
  "type": "new_client",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reasoning": "The user asks about pricing and wants to book a consultation.",
  "draft": null
}
```

#### 2. `route-enquiry`

**Responsibility:** Map the classification to an internal team and priority level.

**Key constraints:**
- Hard-coded mapping in the prompt (not learned from examples):
  - `new_client` → Sales
  - `support_request` → Technical Support
  - `complaint` → Complaints
  - `general_question` / `needs_clarification` → General
- Priority rules embedded:
  - `complaint` → high
  - `support_request` with "urgent/down/broken/critical" → high
  - `new_client` → medium
  - `general_question` → low
- Team must be one of: Sales, Technical Support, Complaints, General
- Priority must be one of: low, medium, high

**Output format:**
```json
{
  "team": "Sales",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

#### 3. `generate-response`

**Responsibility:** Draft a professional, empathetic response and a recommended action for the staff member.

**Tone guardrails (recently added based on user feedback):**
- Professional, empathetic, concise
- No false promises (exact timelines, refunds)
- **No em-dashes (—)** — use commas or separate sentences for a natural human voice
- **Fixed sign-off:** `Warm regards, Strata Team` — never `[Your Name]`
- Complaints: acknowledge frustration, apologise sincerely, offer next steps
- New clients: enthusiastic, outline clear next steps

**Output format:**
```json
{
  "draft": "Dear Sarah, thank you for reaching out...",
  "recommended_action": "Follow up within 24 hours with a detailed quote."
}
```

### Structured JSON Output Handling

Every skill ends with:
```markdown
Return **only** a JSON object with this exact shape. No markdown, no explanation.
```

However, models (especially local ones) sometimes add markdown fences or trailing commas. The skill runner (`src/lib/skill-runner.ts`) has a robust parser:

1. **Strips code fences** — removes ` ```json ... ``` ` wrappers
2. **Brace-matching extraction** — finds the first valid `{ ... }` or `[ ... ]` block
3. **Trailing comma cleanup** — removes `, }` and `, ]` patterns
4. **Falls back to full-string parse** if brace-matching fails

This normalises output across all providers, so the orchestrator always receives clean structured data.

### Provider Behaviour Comparison

| Provider | Model | JSON Reliability | Tone Adherence |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o | Excellent | Good |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Excellent | Excellent (best at empathy) |
| Google | Gemini 1.5 Flash | Good | Good |
| Ollama | llama3.2 | Fair | Fair |

The prompt calibration and robust JSON parser ensure consistent behaviour regardless of provider.

## 4. Error Handling

### Philosophy

Errors are **visible to the user** and **structured for code**. The system never silently fails. Every failure path produces a clear message in the UI and a typed error in the API response.

### Typed Provider Errors

A custom `ProviderError` class wraps all AI provider failures:

```typescript
export class ProviderError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code: "timeout" | "auth" | "network" | "unknown"
  ) { ... }
}
```

| Code | Cause | Timeout | User Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timeout` | Request exceeded limit | 10s (cloud), 60s (Ollama) | "Request timed out. Try again or switch provider." |
| `auth` | Invalid API key / rate limit | — | "Authentication failed. Check your API key." |
| `network` | Provider unreachable | — | "Provider unavailable. Check settings or try Ollama." |
| `unknown` | Unexpected failure | — | "Something went wrong. Please try again." |

### Input-Level Errors

#### Vague or Nonsensical Input

**Example input:** "help" or "??"

**Flow:**
1. `classify-enquiry` returns `type: "needs_clarification"`, low confidence
2. Orchestrator sets `needs_review: true`
3. **Routing and response generation are skipped** (saving tokens)
4. Dashboard shows a **Clarification Draft** card — a pre-written polite follow-up question the staff member can copy and send

This turns a bad input into an **actionable workflow step** rather than a dead end.

#### Low-Confidence Input

**Example input:** "I have a question about something."

**Flow:**
1. `classify-enquiry` returns a type + confidence 0.55
2. Orchestrator sets `needs_review: true`, reason: "Low confidence classification"
3. Routing and response generation are skipped
4. Dashboard shows **Needs Human Review** badge
5. Staff can manually route or request clarification

### Partial Failures

Sometimes classification succeeds but a downstream skill fails (provider hiccup, timeout, etc.):

**Flow:**
1. `classify-enquiry` succeeds
2. `route-enquiry` or `generate-response` fails
3. Orchestrator returns the **successful classification** plus a `routingError` or `responseError` field
4. Dashboard shows the partial result plus a visible error banner

This prevents one failing skill from hiding the successful results of another.

### Request Validation

The `/api/process` endpoint validates every request:

| Violation | Response |
|---|---|
| Missing `enquiry` | `400 Bad Request` — "Missing required fields" |
| Missing `providerType` or `model` | `400 Bad Request` — "Missing required fields" |
| Invalid `providerType` | `400 Bad Request` — "Invalid providerType" |
| Malformed JSON body | `400 Bad Request` — "Invalid request body" |

### UI Error States

Errors are surfaced at multiple levels:

| Level | Component | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| Config | `Layout` banner | "Configuration Required" with link to Configure AI |
| Row | `EnquiryRow` / `GmailInbox` | Red "Error" badge |
| Detail | `EnquiryEntryCard` / `EnquiryDrawer` | Red error card with icon + message |
| Chat | `ChatThread` | Red team message bubble with error text |

### Recovery Paths

| Scenario | User Action |
|---|---|
| Provider timeout | Retry, or switch provider in Configure AI |
| Low confidence | Click into enquiry → manually route or edit |
| Needs clarification | Copy the pre-generated draft → send to client |
| Routing failed | Classification is still visible → manually assign team |
| Response failed | Classification + routing visible → write manual response |

---

## 5. Automation Potential

### Stateless API Design

The `/api/process` and `/api/generate-response` endpoints are **stateless** — they require no sessions, cookies, or database. Any system that can make an HTTP POST can integrate.

### API Contracts

#### `POST /api/process`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enquiry": "I want a quote for strata management.",
  "providerType": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "apiKey": "sk-...",
  "sender": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "classification": {
    "type": "new_client",
    "confidence": 0.94,
    "reasoning": "The user asks about pricing and wants a quote."
  },
  "routing": {
    "team": "Sales",
    "priority": "medium"
  },
  "flags": {
    "needs_review": false,
    "reason": null
  },
  "error": null,
  "routingError": null
}
```

#### `POST /api/generate-response`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "enquiry": "I want a quote for strata management.",
  "classification": "new_client",
  "providerType": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "apiKey": "sk-..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": {
    "draft": "Dear John, thank you for your interest...",
    "recommended_action": "Follow up within 24 hours with a detailed quote."
  }
}
```

### Integration Scenarios

#### Email System

**Inbound webhook:**
A `pages/api/webhooks/email.ts` endpoint could receive forwarded emails (via Zapier, Make, or mail server rules), POST the body to `/api/process`, and store the result.

```typescript
// Pseudo-code
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { from, subject, body } = req.body;
  const result = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/process", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      enquiry: body,
      providerType: "openai",
      model: "gpt-4o",
      sender: from,
    }),
  });
  const data = await result.json();
  // Store in DB, create ticket, etc.
}
```

**Outbound send queue:**
When `generate-response` succeeds and `flags.needs_review === false`, an outbox adapter can queue the draft for sending via SendGrid / AWS SES / Microsoft Graph. If review is needed, the email is held and a staff member is notified.

#### CRM Integration

The classification and routing data maps cleanly to CRM objects:

| Field | CRM Action |
|---|---|
| `classification.type === "new_client"` | Create a `Lead` or `Opportunity` |
| `classification.type === "support_request"` | Create a `Case` linked to existing `Contact` |
| `routing.team` | Assign owner by team |
| `response.draft` | Log as an `Activity` or `Note` on the record |
| `flags.needs_review === true` | Set status to `"Pending Review"` |
| `classification.reasoning` | Add to description for context |

**Example Salesforce flow:**
1. Webhook receives enquiry
2. Calls `/api/process`
3. If `new_client` → creates `Lead` with `Source = "Web Enquiry"`
4. If `support_request` → finds `Contact` by email, creates `Case`
5. If `needs_review` → sets `Lead.Status = "Working — Needs Review"`

#### Task Queue / Ticketing

The `routing` object already decides team + priority. Direct mappings:

| Field | Jira | Linear |
|---|---|---|
| `routing.team` | Component / Label | Team |
| `routing.priority` | Priority (P1–P3) | Priority (Low / Med / High / Urgent) |
| `classification.type` | Issue Type | Label |
| `response.recommended_action` | Sub-task | Sub-issue |

**Example Jira flow:**
1. Enquiry processed
2. If `needs_review === true` → create ticket in `TRIAGE` project
3. If `draft` exists (clarification needed) → add sub-task: *"Send clarification email to client"*
4. Else → create ticket in team-specific project

#### Batch Processing

The existing `/api/process-batch` + `/api/job-status` endpoints support bulk ingestion:

1. Submit an array of enquiries → receive job IDs
2. Poll every 2 seconds for completion
3. Process results as they arrive

Ideal for:
- Nightly email imports
- CSV upload workflows
- Migration from an old support inbox

### Current State vs. Full Automation

| Feature | Current (MVP) | Full Automation |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | Manual paste / sample data | Email webhook, CSV upload, API |
| Storage | `localStorage` only | Postgres / Supabase / CRM |
| Routing | Dashboard team tabs | Auto-create ticket in correct system |
| Response | Generate + click "Send" | Auto-send if confidence ≥ 0.9 and no review flag |
| Audit trail | None | Full log of every AI decision |
| Human override | Edit / manual response | Override in CRM / ticket system |

---

## 6. Design Decisions Summary

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Next.js full-stack** | Single codebase for frontend and API. No separate backend deployment. |
| **No database in MVP** | All state in `localStorage`. Zero-config, easy to run for exam submission. |
| **Skill markdown prompts** | Externalised so non-engineers can tune prompts without touching TypeScript. Versioned in git. |
| **Local-first AI option** | Ollama support means the system works entirely offline for demos or privacy-sensitive environments. |
| **Conditional downstream skills** | Hard rules in the orchestrator (confidence < 0.7 → skip) prevent expensive LLM calls and bad outputs on uncertain inputs. |
| **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS** | Accessible, themeable components with minimal custom CSS. |
| **Zod + React Hook Form** | Type-safe configuration form with client-side validation before storage. |
| **Two-step architecture** | Separates routing (automatic) from response generation (staff-reviewed), ensuring human oversight on client-facing communication. |
| **Batch job queue** | `/api/process-batch` decouples submission from execution, supporting bulk ingestion without blocking the UI. |
| **Provider-agnostic interface** | Single `AIProvider` interface with 4 adapters. Switching providers is a dropdown change, not a code change. |
